Many attempts have been starting to find the instrumental figure of the Eternal Realms and yet no effort was crowned with success. While the Keepers of Eternos fulfill their task dutifully, they set their gaze upon the great task, which is finding who they lost and keeping away the dangers which threaten the galaxy unlike anything seen before."

Under the guidance of their own Eternal Keeper, they separated from the rest of the Keepers of Eternos, to take a different approach on the task of unveiling the mysteries of existence. While eternity is a burden as well as a gift, The Continuum sets their gaze upon a new path, a path that certainly leads them away from the old teachings of Eternos. While they remain undeniably strong within society, one cannot deny the differences between the two."
