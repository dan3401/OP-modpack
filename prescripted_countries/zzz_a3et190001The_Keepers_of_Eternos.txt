Many attempts have been starting to find the instrumental figure of the Eternal Realms and yet no effort was crowned with success. While the Keepers of Eternos fulfill their task dutifully, they set their gaze upon the great task, which is finding who they lost and keeping away the dangers which threaten the galaxy unlike anything seen before."
