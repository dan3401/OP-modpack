Under the guidance of their own Eternal Keeper, they separated from the rest of the Keepers of Eternos, to take a different approach on the task of unveiling the mysteries of existence. While eternity is a burden as well as a gift, The Continuum sets their gaze upon a new path, a path that certainly leads them away from the old teachings of Eternos. While they remain undeniably strong within society, one cannot deny the differences between the two."
