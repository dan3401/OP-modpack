The reason for this name is unknown.\nThere are two unique features of this planet. First, the entire surface of the planet is unusually electrified, and so much so that energy can be directly extracted from the litosphere. Secondly, strange boxes are scattered all over the planet, within which various resources appear from time to time."

 apsr.24001.desc:0 "The planet «Talisman», known for its extremely electrified surface, now provides us with its energy. A power plant that uses the potential difference of the planet's surface costs a small amount of minerals, but gradually the energy supply is depleted and the power station needs to be moved to another location."
