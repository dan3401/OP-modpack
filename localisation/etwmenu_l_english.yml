Most of our people are excited to discover its mysteries. But there are also those which remind constantly of the obligations we have to keep. We have special resonsibilites against the galaxy and its members. Our knoweldge is unsurpassed by any beeing we know so far. And it is up to us to make use of it. We have to be careful however as our unimaginable powers are a easily considered godlike by the primtives of this galaxy. But we know better, neither good, nor magic exists and primitive only call them as such because of the lack of explanations. Through our eternal powers, primtives may call them psionic, others may call them magic, we are able to raise our cities, build our fleet and almost anything at our disposal. We would do better to make sure that this galaxy is most fruitful for our endevours."

 twarrival.3.desc:0 "Since we arrived only shortly within this new cycle, it will take time for us to adjust to this plane of realtiy. Such process can take millennia as the vast powers each individual of our societies possesses are so immense that they need to be released with consideration and care, not to tear upon reality itself. However our physical existance within this plane will always be flawed compared to what we are familiar with from the eternal realms. We will hold our responisibilities true and adjust our immortal powers towards this galaxy in an adequate way, anything else is punished with true death, a real end of existance of the individual. While we can ascend and decent from the Eternal Realms as we please, making our people invulnerable, we may want to choose to focus upon certain tasks. The question is what we hold dearer within this cycle. Our own individual powers? Our craftmansship and knowledge? It us up to us to choose which path we want to go. Do we want to use the vast psionic powers which we call our birthright or do we want to press our name onto this cycle with structures beyond imagining? It is up to us"
 
 twarrival.4.name:0 "The secrets of Cosmic Matter"
 twarrival.4.desc:0 "Many cycles ago, one of our Philosophers discovered a mystical matter we called Cosmic Matter. Its properties were so vast so unususal that not even our minds of eternal wisdom could grasp its true nature. Many cycles have passed since then and our knowledbe about the Cosmic Matter has grown significantly. Its complexity make it incomprehensible to any younger race and its pure existance should be against all known rules of the Kosmos. It has the potential to bend all space and time, to tear upon reality and to create whole new ones. Its untold powers are what make it incredibly valued even to us. However we did not unlock its full potential yet. Many parts of the mystical eterniuma are still not understood. Many more cycles will pass till we grasp its true nature. None the less we can use a portion of its potential to create powerful artifacts, weapons or other things. From what we know, we are able to gather it with machines almost like a mine which complexity would make every head of a mortal burst. Or we can choose to create with the untold powers which are our birthright. Our pure will can be enough to create, once our psionic potential has been unleashed upon this galaxy. The choice of path is ours."

Many people have developed new skills, and as our people shift, we notice that there is something within us. Something we cannot describe diffrently than a spark of divinity. We should prepare and reshape our society in order to fullfill our great destinity. However many will look with jealousy to us and fear our power, we should prepare for the worst"
