 BI_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Hello friends!"
 BI_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Our scientists always wondered if [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] would be interested in some xeno-compatibility. Do you think it could work?"

 AE_OPPOSING_GREETING_01:0 "Your false ideas and values must not be allowed to propagate in this galaxy!"
 AE_OPPOSING_GREETING_02:0 "Keep talking. No one believes you."
 
 AE_SAME_GREETING_01:0 "Our shared values are compatible. Would the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] consider an alliance?"
 AE_SAME_GREETING_02:0 "We should work together."
 
 BAD_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_01:0 "Did... did you STEAL our technologies? When will the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] do something about their scientists' theft of technology?"
 BAD_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_02:0 "Try not to blow yourselves up with Dark Matter Power. Scattered bits of [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] make an awful mess."
 BAD_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_03:0 "Not sure how you stole Dark Matter Power, but stealing is not mature behaviour." 
 BAD_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_04:0 "So you think us equals now? Allow us to demonstration the falsehood of this assumption."
 BAD_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_05:0 "Your mastery of Dark Matter fails to make your communications any less irritating."
 BAD_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_06:0 "Your technological advances far outpace the maturity of your civilization."
 BAD_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_07:0 "Nope, you're still making that raspy noise, like children learning to speak."
 
 GOOD_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_01:0 "It's nice to be in the company of civilized lifeforms. Wouldn't you agree [From.GetSpeciesName]?"
 GOOD_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_02:0 "Your technologies intrigue our scientists."
 GOOD_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_03:0 "Let's not forget, the fact [From.GetName] is so successful today, is in no small part due to the support of [Root.GetName]."
 GOOD_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_04:0 "Good, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], Good!"
 
 NEUTRAL_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_01:0 "We [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] often wonder what you will do next, now that you have unlocked the secrets of this universe." 
 NEUTRAL_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_02:0 "Does it also amuse the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] to watch these other children play?"
 NEUTRAL_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_03:0 "Your mastery over dark matter is impressive. We may have underestimated your capabilities."
 NEUTRAL_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_04:0 "How did you advance so quickly? Was your civilization guided by an entity not of this galaxy, but from a different dimension?"
 NEUTRAL_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_05:0 "Care to join [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] for a game of Stellaris?"
 NEUTRAL_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_06:0 "Is this the zenith of your civilization before you blink out of existence? Time will tell."
 NEUTRAL_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_07:0 "[Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] should really consider clothing befitting of their civilization's stature. Just a pointer."
 
 NEUTRAL_DEFAULT_TO_AE_GREETING_01:0 "Your Dark Matter technologies intrigue our scientists. Can we send in a team to study them?"
 NEUTRAL_DEFAULT_TO_AE_GREETING_02:0 "We should setup a joint research team to discover all potential applications of Dark Matter Power."
 NEUTRAL_DEFAULT_TO_AE_GREETING_03:0 "How did you make Dark Matter work like that?"
 
 GOOD_DEFAULT_TO_AE_GREETING_01:0 "We are ready to follow the [From.GetName]."
 GOOD_DEFAULT_TO_AE_GREETING_02:0 "What is thy bidding?"
 GOOD_DEFAULT_TO_AE_GREETING_03:0 "We await the day you will share your technologies with us."
 GOOD_DEFAULT_TO_AE_GREETING_04:0 "You honor us with your presence, [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName]."
 GOOD_DEFAULT_TO_AE_GREETING_05:0 "What would you ask of our humble empire, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]?"
 GOOD_DEFAULT_TO_AE_GREETING_06:0 "Your enigmatic technology is often confused for magic among the [Root.GetAdj] populace."
 GOOD_DEFAULT_TO_AE_GREETING_07:0 "The [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] people hope to someday achieve a measure of your greatness."
 
 BAD_AFE_TO_AE_GREETING_01:0 "We demand compensation for the stolen Dark Matter technologies!"
 BAD_AFE_TO_AE_GREETING_02:0 "Your mastery of the forbidden technologies are nothing but a farce, a mask to hide your primitive nature."
 BAD_AFE_TO_AE_GREETING_03:0 "You think a mastery of Dark Matter is enough to compare to a civilization that is millennia old?"
 BAD_AFE_TO_AE_GREETING_04:0 "Once a primitive, always a primitive. We will gladly send you back to Stone Ages."
 
 NEUTRAL_AFE_TO_AE_GREETING_01:0 "Perhaps, the [From.GetName] have a role to play still."
 NEUTRAL_AFE_TO_AE_GREETING_02:0 "If you stay out of our way, we might stay out of yours."
 NEUTRAL_AFE_TO_AE_GREETING_03:0 "No games, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. The galaxy is at stake."
 NEUTRAL_AFE_TO_AE_GREETING_04:0 "Should we find common ground, our joint forces would be powerful indeed."
 NEUTRAL_AFE_TO_AE_GREETING_05:0 "Are you sure you're observing all safety protocols when handling Dark Matter Power?"
 NEUTRAL_AFE_TO_AE_GREETING_06:0 "We will show you the grace and power of a civilization that has matured with age, not just technological advances."
 NEUTRAL_AFE_TO_AE_GREETING_07:0 "Why do our ships look so similar? This raises serious questions."
 
 FE_TO_LOST_01:0 "We see a lot of our past self in you."
 FE_TO_LOST_02:0 "How the mighty have fallen."
 FE_TO_LOST_03:0 "So you have accepted the truth, that the galaxy will evolve the way it was always destined to, regardless of our will."
 FE_TO_LOST_04:0 "Let it go. Let it all go."
 FE_TO_LOST_05:0 "Let the primitives fight amongst themselves while we watch."
 FE_TO_LOST_06:0 "The primitives will never listen...and that is why they are primitives. Trying to let them see a higher form of existence is ultimately, futile."
 FE_TO_LOST_07:0 "We've been there. Trust us, we know."
 
 HIVE_EMPIRE_TO_AE_GREETING_01:0 "Our mind finds it...difficult...to adjust to your rebirth."
 HIVE_EMPIRE_TO_AE_GREETING_02:0 "We just want to eat..."
 HIVE_EMPIRE_TO_AE_GREETING_03:0 "We are eating. Check back later."
 
 AE_TO_LOST_01:0 "We are glad you have seen sense that there can only be room for one of us in the galaxy."
 AE_TO_LOST_02:0 "Is that all you've got?"
 AE_TO_LOST_03:0 "So soon?"
 AE_TO_LOST_04:0 "Stay out and don't come back."
 
 LOST_TO_AE_01:0 "You don't know the power of [Root.GetName]."
 LOST_TO_AE_02:0 "Fools. The more wars you fight the more respect slips from your tentacles."
 LOST_TO_AE_03:0 "We will be back."
 LOST_TO_AE_04:0 "You haven't yet realised the truth that might doesn't make right. Your technologies are but a charade to who you really are."
