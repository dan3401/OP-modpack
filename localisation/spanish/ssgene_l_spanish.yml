 ssgene.50.name:0 "The Origin of the Biomorph"
 ssgene.50.desc:0 "Our scientists would like you to know that with our recent advancements in gene seed purification, the creation of new life is finally within our grasp. Though simple in design and cognitive function, these 'biomorphs' will have a great capacity for future genetic modifications."
 ssgene.51.name:0 "The Pinnacle of Evolution"
 ssgene.51.desc:0 "We have achieved something that few have ever dreamed: Complete mastery over the fundamental building blocks of life. We can now precisely manipulate any aspect of an organism, from climate preference, to physical and mental capacities, to size and sociability. Infinite diversity in infinite combinations.\n\nYet there is still more that we can achieve. With our flawless comprehension of genetic structures and organic lifeforms, our lead scientists believe that the apex may be within our grasp: Turning our own people into perfect biomorphs."

 ssgene.200.desc:0 "It is done. Our people have been broken down and reforged anew into better, stronger, faster biomorphic shells. It will take time for many to get used to their new identities, but they will thank us for it in the end. We are now a full step above the competition; organic life created from scratch in a lab, not forced through the trial-and-error of evolutionary processes."
