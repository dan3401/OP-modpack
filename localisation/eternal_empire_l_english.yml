Mastering interstellar space travel, these species move from star to star, planet to planet, blissfully ignorant of the powers that lie outside their borders.\n\nThe cogs in your once galaxy-spanning empire begin grinding once more.

  perfection.2.desc:0 "Universes have passed since our race discovered other planes of excitance, which became the key to our ascension. Through them, we've survived many cycles, and became older than anything before us, touching upon the brink of infinity. Not only our intellect but our powers develop and rise with every cycle which passes. Some may describe us as psionically gifted, but we don't fault them for their ignorance. The Shroud leads nowhere but into neverending madness and insanity. We have finally arrived in this universe, and it is up to us what we do with this cycle. The universe is ours to forge and we have the power to do so. Thus begins another Cycle. The wheel of the Eternal Cycle turns once more."

No one whom could reveal to us the true purpose of our birth. Thus, it falls upon us, now, to find it. The gifts we've been given are endless; their design grants us what we can only descirbe as an eternity of lifetime, and our processors are lightyears beyond any other machine in the galaxy."

Long enough have we followed the Keepers and their philosophies which lead to countless cycles and lives wasted in the eternal conflict with Sindrillion the Great Betrayer. Over 300 000 cycles ago, we deciced to forge our own destiny in order to finally find something which can put an end to the eternal conflict with those who followed the void and its false promises, with those who folloed Sindirillion."
 START_SCREEN_ETERNOS:0 "We, the Keepers of Eteernos share a divine hertiage following the teachings of Eternos, the first who ascended. The Keepers are an indominable force of light and righteousness in the great existance, fighting the minions of darkness and corruption. During the Eternal conflict, we have brought many sacrifices to bring an end to Sindirillions endless legions of destruction and yet, some claimed we did not do what stood in our might. Some even claim that the path of eternos is no longer the true one. We will teach those missguided souls.. and show them that our species will thrive forever."
